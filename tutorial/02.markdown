Other common operations provided by key-value stores are [DEL](#help%20del) to delete a given
key and associated value, SET-if-not-exists (called [SETNX](#help%20setnx) on Redis) that sets a
key only if it does not already exist, and [INCR](#help%20incr) to atomically increment a
number stored at a given key:

<pre><code>
    <a href="#SET%20connections%2010">SET connections 10</a>
    <a href="#INCR%20connections">INCR connections</a> => 11
    <a href="#INCR%20connections">INCR connections</a> => 12
    <a href="#DEL%20connections">DEL connections</a>
    <a href="#INCR%20connections">INCR connections<a/> => 1
</code></pre>
