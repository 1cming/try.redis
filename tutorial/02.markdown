### Key-Value Store Basics

The essence of a key-value store is the ability to store some data, called a
value, inside a key. This data can later be retrieved only if we know the exact
key used to store it. There is no way to search for something by value.

So for example I can use the command SET to store the value bar at key foo:

> SET foo bar

Redis will store our data permanently, so we can later ask for "What is the
value stored at key foo?" and Redis will reply with bar:

> GET foo => bar

Other common operations provided by key-value stores are DEL used to delete a
given key, and the associated value, SET-if-not-exists (called SETNX on Redis)
that sets a key only if it does not already exist, and INCR that is able to
atomically increment a number stored at a given key:

> SET foo 10
> INCR foo => 11
> INCR foo => 12
> INCR foo => 13
